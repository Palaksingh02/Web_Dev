// In JavaScript we have only two types of values

// 2. Primitive data types

/*
There are  seven types of primitive data types :
1. Number = Used for decimals and integers (let age = 30)
2. String  = Used for text (let n = "Rajesh")
3. Boolean = Used for taking decision (true or false)
4. Undefined = Value taken by variable which is not defined yet (let children) value of the varialbe and type of the variable both undefined
5. Null = Empty value (?????? JAVASCRIPT BUG  == The typeof null is Object)
6. Symbol = Value that is unique and cannot be changed
7. BigInt = Large Integer than Number type can hold
*/

// JavaScript has dynamic typing // That is we don't have to manually define the datatype of variable // Datatypes are determined automatically

// ********* It is actually the value that holds the datatype and not the variable

console.log(typeof true);
console.log(typeof "PALAK");
console.log(typeof 23);
// typeof are basically used to determine the type of value


// Declaration of vaiables 

// ***********************************************************************88

// 1st type is let

// Using let we can re-assign the value of variable that is basically we can mutate the value of variable
let abc = 30;
abc=31
// || No ERROR ABOVE ||

// ***********************************************************************88

// 2nd type is const

// const does not allows us to reassign the values in a variable
// We need to assign an initilization value
const edf = 30;
//edf=31;
// || ERROR ABOVE ||

// ***********************************************************************88

// 3rd type is var 
var let =30;
let ="PALAK"
var let = true;
// Re-assigning and re-declaration ==> Both are possible


// ############ We can also execute a varible without defining the type of variable
last = "SIngh";
console.log(last);
// This works perfectly fine but this is actually a bad practice 
// It is because that is will not create the variable in the so-called scope instead js will create a property on the global object


// Use of OPERATORS
const now = 2037
const ageJonas = now - 1991; // 46
const ageSarah = now - 2018; // 19

console.log(ageJonas,ageSarah); // 46 19 ===> ,separated in console log gives space separated result

// 2**3 = 2^3 = 8
// '+' operator is used for adding operation for numbers and for conacating of strings 

var a ="Palak";
var b ="Singh";
console.log(a+' '+b);

// ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
let x = 10 + 5 ; // 10+5 // 15
x+=10 ; // x+10 // 25
x*=4 ;  //x*4  // 100
x++;   // x+1 // 101

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

/*
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).
3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ðŸ˜‰
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.
TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123

Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
